 <h2>Analysis and Interpretation: </h2>
<p class="p1">The poem was written in a haiku method. Additionally, this poem also consists of 5 stanzas, and each stanza has its own 3 lines. 
I noticed that each line was changing into a different rhyme scheme. 
The first stanza follows an ABA pattern, then all the other stanza follows an increasing rhyme scheme of CDE, FGH, IJK, and LMN. 
The author depicts his emotion in the poem in a comedic way. Interestingly, this poem challenges my imagination. 
 
This literature has 4 literary devices. From the first stanza, 
repetition and irony explain how forgetful the author was and might have a short-term memory. 
The second stanza has personification, which tells us that a bear could feel human emotion. 
The third stanza has irony that talks about how humans put machines in our glasses but never invented a jetpack. 
The fourth stanza tells us how our ancestors hunted for food, but now, in the present, we just need to go to Walmart.
Lastly, the fifth stanza explains how bananas used to have a seed and creates an image in my mind. 
Moreover, this stanza also explains that we humans could change our world. 

 
From the poem I read, I concluded that the author was trying to tell us that 
we have the power to change everything. Furthermore, we can change our fate, our community, our 
environment, and ourselves. Everything was in our hands, and these changes still guided humanity to this day </p>
